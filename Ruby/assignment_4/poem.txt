BE composed - be at ease with me - I am Walt Whitman, liberal and 
lusty as Nature, 
Not till the sun excludes you do I exclude you, 
Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you and the leaves to 
rustle for you, do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you.
My girl I appoint with you an appointment, and I charge you that you 
make preparation to be worthy to meet me, 
And I charge you that you be patient and perfect till I come.
Till then I salute you with a significant look that you do not 
forget me.
